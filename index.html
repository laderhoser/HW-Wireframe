Chicken fingers… with spicy club sauce. One for the ladies. Yes, Annyong. Your name is Annyong! We all know you're Annyong! And guess what else is back. [slow wink] My breakfast? My friskiness. Mama horny Michael.

								So you take your mom to work every day? Bummer. Moms are such a pain in the ass, huh? It's, like, die already! So, what do you say? We got a basket full of father-son fun here. What's Kama Sutra oil? Maybe it's not for us. Daddy horny, Michael.

					<p>Look at us, crying like a bunch of girls on the last day of camp. They don't allow you to have bees in here. [Stabbing Gob] White power! Gob: I'm white! I made a huge tiny mistake. I cheated and I lied and I whored around. There's unlimited juice? This party is gonna be off the hook. Fried cheese… with club sauce. Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce. Chicken fingers… with spicy club sauce. One for the ladies. Yes, Annyong. Your name is Annyong! We all know you're Annyong! And guess what else is back. [slow wink] My breakfast? My friskiness.

Everything they do is so dramatic and flamboyant. It just makes me want to set myself on fire. I'm gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings?</p>
